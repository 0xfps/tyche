# Tyche

Tyche will be an NFT rating protocol designed for newly minted NFTs. NFT owners can list their project on the protocol with detailed explanations of use cases and benefits, and protocol users can rate the project on a scale of 1 - 10 (less likely to most likely), based on their perceived chances of success of the NFT.

It might serve as an NFT curation protocol.
